  abstract = {We present an extensive, annotated bibliography of the abstract machines designed for each of the main programming paradigms (imperative, object oriented, functional, logic and concurrent). We conclude that whilst a large number of efficient abstract machines have been designed for particular language implementations, relatively little work has been done to design abstract machines in a systematic fashion.}
